# Installation

Let's install **laboratory** in **less than 3 minutes**.

## Linux & macOS

Run this command `curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mooziii/laboratory/dev/chemicae/packages/autoinstall.sh | bash`

You will be prompted for your sudo password (installation methods that don't require root access will come soon).

### Tab Completion

Tab completion is currently only available for bash and zsh (I didn't test zsh yet so 50/50 chance that it will work).
Just restart your shell after the installation and it works just fine.
