# Using Modrinth modpacks

To create a server based on a modrinth modpack you can use `laboratory modrinth <modpack-link>` (`<modpack-link>` is the exact download link of the modpack).
You may get messages saying that a file is corrupted but that's fine, laboratory will download the files again to make sure they're okay!

### How to get the exact link

Go to the "Versions" tab of the modpack and select the version you want to use. Now, right click the download button and copy the link.
