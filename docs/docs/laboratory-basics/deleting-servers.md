# Deleting servers

If you want to delete a server because you no longer need the server, run `laboratory rm <server-name>` or the long command `laboratory server delete <server-name>`.
The delete-command has the following options available:

- `-y` or `--yes` will delete the server without any confirmation needed. **Use with caution!**

In case you have a typo in your servers name, you can [rename the server](/docs/configuring-servers/edit-laboratory-server)
