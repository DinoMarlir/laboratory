In the future of laboratory I want to focus on the server side of laboratory. That means the focus will be on features
like automatic starting of servers at a certain player rate or similar stuff. A feature that I'll definitely want in laboratory
is a nice and useful web-panel and a REST API to control laboratory servers from the outside. Also, something like managing servers via ingame commands
is a feature that will be added in the near future.
